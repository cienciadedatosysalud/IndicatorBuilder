# IndicatorBuilder

Effortlessly generate indicator calculation script templates using 'IndicatorBuilder'. This web tool reads a CSV file, where each column represents an indicator by including its respective definition codes, and outputs a script template ready to be copied and used in R or Python. You can streamline your data analysis workflow with 'IndicatorBuilder'.
 
The use of 'IndicatorBuilder' complements the Python library [IndicPy4Health](https://cienciadedatosysalud.github.io/IndicPy/#) and the R package [IndicR4Health](https://cienciadedatosysalud.github.io/IndicR4Health/), providing an easy-to-use tool scripting the definition of any indicator within your preferred programming environment.
